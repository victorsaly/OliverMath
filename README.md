# OliverVocabulary

Oliver's Vocabulary Game is a tool created by my son. He wanted to have a robot that talks and accept answer similar to Alexa.

This tool allows kids between 7+ years old to practice math and use azure speech API to interpret the answer and compare it with the question.

Any correct answers are praised with a start and wrong answer are responded with the correct answer and ask to try again, so give it a go and allow your kid to play around with math in a fun way.
